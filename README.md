## What is this?

Cxrili is a simple (installable) Progressive Web App I made for my classmates, It's main purpose is to be an acurate timetable updating on every class rescedule. I am planing on making cxrili more general and accessible for not-my-classmates, that includes the ability to create your own timetables and sharing those timetables.

## features

- [x] live updating time line
- [x] multiple pages for every day of the week
- [x] week view page
- [ ] custom table creation
- [ ] custom table sharing
